/**
 * Reference-odds ingestion model (DESIGN §5). The MM's internal, *usable*
 * representation of upstream reference odds for one (contest, market), plus the
 * mapper from the SDK's per-market odds shapes.
 *
 * The SDK delivers a discriminated per-market shape — `MoneylineOdds`,
 * `SpreadOdds`, `TotalOdds` — whose fields are individually nullable: the writer
 * may have priced one side, the line, both, or neither for a given game. Pricing
 * shouldn't have to null-check upstream fields on every path, so
 * `referenceOddsFromSdk` collapses those shapes to this fully-populated,
 * market-tagged `ReferenceOdds` — or `null` when the upstream data isn't usable
 * yet (a missing side price, or a missing line for spread / total). A `null` is the
 * ingestion-layer signal that there is no usable reference for this market right
 * now; the caller refuses to quote it.
 *
 * This is the foundation the spread / total pricing strategies and line-keyed
 * candidate discovery build on; it is purely a data transform — no SDK calls, no
 * chain, no pricing. (Moneyline today flows through its own
 * `ReferenceMoneylineAmerican` path in `orders/index.ts`; that type is subsumed
 * into `ReferenceOdds` when `buildDesiredQuote` is generalized for spread / total.)
 *
 * Side semantics (DESIGN §5, `OspexTypes.sol`): moneyline and spread are
 * away/home; total is over/under. Line values are decimal points (e.g. `-1.5`,
 * `7.5`) — the on-chain `int32`, 10×-scaled `lineTicks` conversion happens at
 * commitment construction, behind the SDK.
