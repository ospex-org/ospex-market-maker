/**
 * The runner — the event loop (DESIGN §3, §8, §10). One `Runner` per process,
 * mode set by `config.mode.dryRun`. This module is the loop's *machinery* +
 * *discovery* + the *reference-odds* layer:
 *
 *   - the boot path (state load + the boot-time state-loss fail-safe — DESIGN §12);
 *   - the kill-switch (a file at `config.killSwitchFile`, or a SIGTERM / SIGINT →
 *     a graceful shutdown);
 *   - the tick loop;
 *   - **discovery** (every `discovery.everyNTicks` ticks — jittered — find the
 *     verified contests with an open moneyline speculation + a reference-game id
 *     starting within `marketSelection.maxStartsWithinHours`, honour the allow/deny
 *     lists, track up to `marketSelection.maxTrackedContests` of them, untrack the
 *     departed ones; `candidate` telemetry for the skipped/tracked);
 *   - **reference odds** (DESIGN §10's Realtime guardrails): for each tracked
 *     market keep its reference moneyline odds + freshness current — by default a
 *     Supabase Realtime channel per market (snapshot-first seed, then the channel's
 *     `onChange` / `onRefresh` / `onError`), capped at `odds.maxRealtimeChannels`
 *     (markets over the cap stay tracked but *degraded* — no odds — and are retried
 *     when a slot frees); `odds.subscribe: false` falls back to a bounded
 *     per-tick snapshot poll. A channel error degrades the market and the next
 *     discovery cycle re-subscribes it. The `dirty` flag (an `onChange` arrived) is
 *     read-and-cleared by the per-market reconcile — dirty-event coalescing;
 *   - **the per-market reconcile** (DESIGN §3 step 3, §8, §9): for each tracked
 *     market that needs it (its reference odds moved, or it has no fresh two-sided
 *     standing quote of ours, or it has become unquoteable while quotes are still up)
 *     — skipped entirely while the boot-time hold is active (DESIGN §12) — first the
 *     unquoteable gates (game imminent / reference odds missing or stale / odds
 *     channel down / speculation closed): each pulls (soft-cancels) any visible
 *     quote of ours on that speculation — the visible book must never carry a quote
 *     the MM is no longer pricing (DESIGN §2.2 / §3) — and emits a `candidate` skip;
 *     otherwise build the desired two-sided quote (`buildDesiredQuote` over the
 *     hypothetical inventory `inventoryFromState` derives from the persisted state),
 *     `reconcileBook` it against the maker's current book on that speculation, and
 *     apply the plan: in dry-run (the only mode in Phase 2) log it (`quote-intent`
 *     + `would-submit` / `would-replace` / `would-soft-cancel` + a `cap-hit`
 *     candidate per deferred side) and mutate the *hypothetical* inventory (add
 *     synthetic `visibleOpen` records for submits / replacements; reclassify
 *     pulled / replaced records to `softCancelled` — they stay matchable on chain,
 *     so the risk engine keeps counting them); live execution is Phase 3. Then it
 *     measures **quote competitiveness** (DESIGN §8): for each would-be quote, where
 *     it'd sit relative to the visible orderbook on its side (the `getSpeculation`
 *     above already fetched it — no extra read) and to the reference odds — a
 *     `quote-competitiveness` event per side, or one `competitiveness-unavailable`
 *     if that orderbook somehow isn't populated;
 *   - age-out of expired tracked commitments;
 *   - a prune of old terminal (`expired` / `filled` / `authoritativelyInvalidated`)
 *     commitment records, so a long shadow run's state file stays bounded;
 *   - the per-tick state flush;
 *   - an interruptible sleep clamped to the `pollIntervalMs` floor.
 *
 * Still TODO follow-ups: fill-detection (Phase 3 — in dry-run nothing real is
 * posted, so there are no fills to detect; it's the live path's read side, wired
 * with the SDK write calls in Phase 3).
 *
 * No `@ospex/sdk` import — all chain/API access goes through the `OspexAdapter`. The
 * clock, sleep, kill-switch probe, OS-signal registration, and randomness are
 * injectable (`RunnerDeps`) and so is the `OspexAdapter`, so the loop is
 * unit-testable: run a bounded number of ticks; drive shutdown via the kill probe
 * or a simulated signal; pin discovery timing; drive the odds callbacks via a fake
 * `subscribeOdds`; fake `getContest` / `getSpeculation` / `getOddsSnapshot`.

   * `inverseOddsTick(c.oddsTick)` (which is *highest* when the maker tick `c.oddsTick`
   * is *lowest*). So `bestBookTakerTick` = the max of `inverseOddsTick(c.oddsTick)`

   * the book" iff its `takerOddsTick` is at least that high (`takerOddsTick >=

   * `quote-competitiveness` per assessed side, carrying both the taker-facing fields

   *
   * Reuses the orderbook the per-market reconcile's `getSpeculation` already fetched —
   * no extra read; only runs for markets that passed the risk engine and only when
   * the market was dirty / re-reconciled (the reconcile's gate), so it's bounded
   * (DESIGN §8). If the desired quote was refused there's nothing to assess; if the
   * speculation came back without its orderbook (the `SpeculationView.orderbook` is
   * optional — `getContest`'s embedded specs may omit it; `getSpeculation` itself
   * always populates it), it's a degraded read → one `competitiveness-unavailable`.
   *
   * In dry-run the orderbook is purely other makers' (the MM's own synthetic `dry:`
   * commitments are never on chain); the Phase-3 live path should exclude
